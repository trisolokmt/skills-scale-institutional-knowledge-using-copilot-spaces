# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains the living project management process documentation used at OctoAcme. The goal is to give new and existing teammates a single place to find how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve work across cross-functional projects.

## Process Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured, customer-first, iterative approach that emphasizes clear roles, measurable outcomes, and continuous improvement.

- Initiation: Validate ideas, align stakeholders, and define success with a short Project One-pager.
- Planning: Break work into shippable increments, prioritize and estimate the backlog, surface dependencies and risks.
- Execution & Tracking: Use a project board and disciplined PR/CI practices; hold regular team rhythms to surface blockers and show progress.
- Release & Deployment: Meet pre-release criteria, run smoke tests, have rollback plans and post-deploy verifications.
- Risk, Communication & Escalation: Maintain a risk register, run weekly status updates, and escalate issues along defined paths.
- Roles & Personas: Clear ownership by PM, PdM, Devs, QA, and stakeholders with defined responsibilities.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: Capture learnings after sprints, releases, and incidents; turn them into tracked action items.

## How to use these docs

- Start with the Overview for an at-a-glance understanding of our lifecycle and roles.
- Use the Project One-pager during Initiation to capture problem, goal, and success metrics.
- Keep the project README updated as the single source of truth for status, links, and key artifacts.
- Add process-specific details to this repo's docs/ folder (or to .copilot/ if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context).
- When adding or changing process docs, use the `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml` template to request edits and track acceptance criteria.
